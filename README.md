# still-in-the-making
Interactive installation considering human influence on the planet. Audio-visual microcosmos reacts on movement and decisions of users. It requires engagement and considered gestures, relying on the intuitive searching of balance. Combining science & fun together. 

Project was made in Processing 2.02 + Max MSP + Ableton live 9. It uses Primesense drivers for Kinect v1 and OpenNi / NITE libraries. All code was built in Processing 2.02 on Windows 10.
